### Versions
This shows the major work we do on the project. It can be used to determine if a version is supported or not. Read below for more information.

_A supported version is a version that is actively maintained and is considered to be stable **and** secure. A version that is not supported is considered to be deprecated or is planned to be. A version that is not supported may still be used, but is not recommended._

## Contributing
***Help is very much so welcome and needed!***

The project is a ton of microservices that are connected using a central API. All of the code will be compiled to Luau at some point for distribution. If you want to contribute, please just do so and feel free to experiment with the code because we all may learn something new.

When documentation is available, it will be in the Wiki and you can use that as reference. Since each service is a microservice, it is recommended to look at that service's code to see how it works and is structured. Follow the same structure and you should be fine. I won't judge your code, so have fun!

If you have more questions, feel free to contact me on Discord or email me in the [Contact](#contact) section.
