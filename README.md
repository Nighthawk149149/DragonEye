## About

This project is currently under heavy development and is not ready for use. This project is a universal Roblox anti-cheat that is designed to be used in most game.

If you want to contribute, please do so, you can get more information on how to contribute in the [Contributing](#contributing) section.

## Getting Started
WIP

### Prerequisites
WIP

### Installation
WIP

### Versions
The ISO 8601 column acts as a UID for the version. When the ISO 8601 is changed that means an update is avalible.

The Supported column tells you if the version is being actively developed **or** has constant security updates. It is recommended to use a supported version to ensure the best security and performance.

The API column tells you what version the API is at. If the API is the same between two or more versions, then the API is backwards compatible for those versions. If the API is different, then the API is not backwards compatible and needs to be updated within the game to work with the new version.

The Released column tells you if the version is released or not. If it is then you can find it under releases. If not then the version is not intended for public use and is only for testing.

**\* - Development version (Latest Changes at the time of commit)**

## Usage
WIP

## Contributing
***Help is very much so welcome and needed!***

The project is a ton of microservices that are connected using a central API. All of the code will be compiled to Luau at some point for distribution. If you want to contribute, please just do so and feel free to experiment with the code because we all may learn something new.

When documentation is available, it will be in the Wiki and you can use that as reference. Since each service is a microservice, it is recommended to look at that service's code to see how it works and is structured. Follow the same structure and you should be fine. I won't judge your code, so have fun!

If you have more questions, feel free to contact me on Discord or email me in the [Contact](#contact) section.
