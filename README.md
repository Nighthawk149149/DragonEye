## About
This project is currently under heavy development and is not ready for use. This project is a universal Roblox anti-cheat that is designed to be used in most game.

The first version that can be used will be `1.0.0` and any version before is a dev version. If you want to contribute to this project, please wait for the contribution guidelines to be released or just do what you want because I don't care and help is needed.
